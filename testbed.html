                <p>The idea of building a test environment is not new or unique to DOE or its Advanced Scientific
                    Computing Research (ASCR) program office. The proposed Federated IRI Science Testbed (FIRST) enables
                    a progressive design-experiment-test-refine cycle to establish a shared environment for IRI
                    developers and pilot application users to come together and advance the overall vision by
                    experimenting with the design patterns and addressing the gaps identified in the IRI Architecture
                    Blueprint Activity (ABA) Final Report.</p>

                <p>The Federated IRI Science Testbed (FIRST) is further described in its 2023 white paper: <a

                <p>Key Testbed activities planned in FY24/25:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Catalog existing testbeds at the ASCR compute facilities, e.g., ALCF Edith, NERSC

                            target="_blank">OLCF ACE testbed</a>, <a
                            href="https://www.es.net/network-r-and-d/experimental-network-testbeds"
                            target="_blank">ESnet testbed</a></li>
                    <li>Co-design and implement plan to connect existing ASCR testbeds together using ESnet testbed
                        network.</li>
                    <li>Develop a best current practice connection service template that can be used to connect other
                        (e.g. non-ASCR) test environments to the IRI testbed.</li>
                    <li>Publish facility-specific testbed access procedures, acceptable use policies, etc.</li>
                    <li>Identify and execute early test cases to validate initial IRI testbed design, e.g.,
                        GRETA/Deleria, EJFAT, and <a href="https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/depts/data-systems/projects/lclstream">LCLStream</a>.</li>
