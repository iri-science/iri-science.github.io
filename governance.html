                <h3>IRI Governance</h3>
                <p>One of the main activities in FY24 is to develop the program governance structure. This includes
                    three clear areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Federal oversight.</strong> This includes the IRI Executive Authority and IRI Steering
                        Committee (led by ASCR Facilities Division), and will include mechanisms for accountability to
                        other contributing offices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management Council.</strong> This includes the management structures (defined in more
                        detail below), and the Technical Subcommittees who will execute the work required. Initially,
                        this will consist primarily of ASCR staff, but will expand as funding becomes available for IRI
                        activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>User groups.</strong> This includes computing facilities, science teams.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Governance structure will be inclusive; other offices will be engaged and participate.</p>

                <h4>IRI Executive Subcommittee</h4>
                <p>The IRI Executive Committee is composed of ASCR facility directors. Their primary responsibilities
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scope Definition:</strong> Define the overall scope of the project based on input from
                        the DOE SC IRI Steering Committee, ensuring that the objectives are clear, achievable, and
                        aligned with IRI goals and facility missions and goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Approach Prioritization:</strong> Prioritize the activities and approaches recommended
                        by the leadership group, determining which strategies will best achieve the IRI objectives
                        efficiently and effectively, given facility mission and resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Allocate resources (people, technical) strategically,
                        ensuring the IRI program has what it needs to succeed while efficiently using organizational
                        assets. Certain resource allocation decisions will depend on DOE acceptance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing Oversight:</strong> Maintain ongoing oversight of the IRI effort, monitoring
                        progress and ensuring it remains aligned with its defined scope and objectives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Reviews:</strong> Conduct yearly reviews of the IRI progress, assessing
                        achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement. Provide constructive feedback and
                        adjustments to strategies as necessary in collaboration with the DOE SC IRI Steering Committee.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Identify potential risks and challenges of the effort,
                        developing and implementing strategies to mitigate these risks effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication and Coordination:</strong> Facilitate open communication and coordination
                        between the IRI management council, stakeholders, and other relevant parties, ensuring that all
                        are aligned and informed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The IRI Leadership Group consists of representatives, one from each of the 5 ASCR facilities. The
                    IRI Leadership Group is a conduit for communication of objectives and progress: it communicates with the leads of the technical and engagement/outreach
                    subcommittees and also reports into the IRI Executive committee.</p>

            <div class="col-12 mb-5">
                <h4>Outreach and Engagement</h4>
                <p>The role of the Outreach/Engagement Technical subcommittee is to coordinate work being done with the
                    pathfinder science teams, identify common requirements and communicate to the Leadership team. This
                    subcommittee is also responsible for broader community engagement, working with science teams who
                    wish to engage more closely with IRI and bringing them into the IRI framework.</p>
                <p>Over time, the set of active IRI projects will expand as resources become available. The list of
                    initial Pathfinder projects is an initial list of projects, not a complete list of projects -
                    facilities and programs that have an interest in working in this space should work with the
                    Engagement subcommittee on establishing collaboration contact points, readiness levels,
                    requirements, and so forth.</p>

            <div class="col-12 mb-5">
                <h4>Interfaces</h4>
                <p>This IRI Interfaces Technical Subcommittee works to gather requirements, define use cases, and specify unified
                    interfaces for the DOE ASCR Facilities. Beyond defining Application Programmable Interfaces (API),
                    this may include the integration of front end applications (e.g. jupyter notebooks) and
                    orchestration systems (including hosted orchestration tools).</p>
                <p>This group is tasked with enhancing the “user experience” for interaction and management of complex
                    workflows across High-Performance Computing Facilities, High-Performance Data Facilities, and
                    High-Performance Scientific Network Facilities, thereby facilitating a more cohesive and efficient
                    research infrastructure. The group will consider applicable standards and build upon the work of
                    other organizations where available to deliver a reference IRI interface implementation.</p>

                <h4>Trusted IRI Designs (TRUSTID)</h4>
                <p>The Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee is established to enable
                    trustworthy and performant execution of cross facility workflows. The TRUSTID subcommittee’s mission
                    is to create a set of design patterns and policy elements that mitigate risks, safeguard assets, and
                    enable a trusted environment for transformative open science.</p>
                <p>Cybersecurity enables open science when security architectures and technologies are effectively
                    integrated into performant and functional workflow designs from the beginning. It is essential that
                    security teams and other stakeholders of all sites and facilities engaged in IRI build partnerships
                    to develop trusted multi-facility workflows that are acceptable to all IRI participants. It is an
                    explicit goal of the IRI TRUSTID Technical Subcommittee to create the design patterns and
                    collaborative relationships to bring this about.</p>
