        <p>The IRI Light Sources Pathfinder is focused on identifying common components and interfaces that will improve
            the integration between Light Source and HPC facilities, using high performance networking. The light
            sources are the <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Advanced Light Source (ALS)</a> and Lawrence
            Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), the <a href="https://www.aps.anl.gov/" target="_blank">Advanced Photon
                Source (APS)</a> at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/"
                target="_blank">National Synchrotron Light Source 2 (NSLS-II)</a> at Brookhaven National Laboratory
            (BNL), and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) at the SLAC National Accelerator
            Laboratory. The computing facilities are the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), the National
            Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center, and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF).
            The Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) connects the Labs and Facilities to each other, and provides the data
            circulatory system for the project.</p>
        <p>Initial efforts are focused on running a set of light source workflows at multiple HPC facilities, and using
            the experience to identify appropriate APIs, common software and workflow components, operational and
            security models, and areas of friction that can be addressed. The intent is to invest the efforts of
            multiple facilities in an integrated approach to making remote HPC easily available to experiments at all
            DOE light sources.</p>
