        <p>The Light Sources Pathfinder is focused on implementing a common prompt processing pipeline for beamlines at
            each of three light source facilities to each of three High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. The light sources are the <a
                href="https://als.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Advanced Light Source (ALS)</a> at Lawrence Berkeley
            National Laboratory (LBNL), the <a href="https://www.aps.anl.gov/" target="_blank">Advanced Photon Source
                (APS)</a> at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and the <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/"
                target="_blank">National Synchrotron Light Source 2 (NSLS-II)</a> at Brookhaven National Laboratory
            (BNL). The computing facilities are the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), the National Energy
            Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF).</p>
        <p>Initial efforts are focused on three tomography beamlines, one at each participating light source. Once that
            is up and running, the pipeline will be expanded to include three ptychography beamlines, one at each
            participating light source. The intent is to invest the efforts of multiple facilities in an integrated
            approach to making remote HPC easily available to experiments at all DOE light sources.</p>
