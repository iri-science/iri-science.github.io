        <p>The Climate and Earth Science Pathfinder Project ties together the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility
            (ALCF) and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), placing earth system model simulation results
            from ALCF and OLCF supercomputers in the <a href="https://esgf.llnl.gov/mission.html" target="_blank">Earth System Grid Federation</a> (ESGF) data platform, housed at Oak
            Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Future activities for this Pathfinder include the integration of Jupyter notebooks and other analysis
            capabilities with the data sets in ESGF, as well as integration of observational data from the <a href="https://www.arm.gov/" target="_blank">Atmospheric
            Radiation Measurement</a> (ARM) facility.</p>
