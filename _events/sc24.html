                            experimental and computational resources of the U.S. research enterprise is central to the
                            Department of Energy concepts of IRI (Integrated Research Infrastructure) for the future of
                            how science is done. It fully aligns with ESnet's vision for the role the network should
                            play in supporting cutting edge research and is critical to the design of the
                            High-Performance Data Facility (HPDF) led by JLab. In this talk we will describe the custom

                This presentation provides an overview of the Department of Energy's Integrated Research Infrastructure
                (IRI) program, a comprehensive initiative designed to enhance and interconnect scientific research
                facilities across the nation. We will discuss how the IRI program aims to create a cohesive network of
                state-of-the-art laboratories, computational resources, and data sharing platforms. The talk will offer
                a brief overview of the program's mission and goals, and Technical Subcommittees (TS) work, with
                particular emphasis on the TRUSTID TS.
