                            Infrastructure (IRI) program, which is designed to enable new modes of integrated science
                            across DOE user facilities. Common or unified interfaces are needed for these workflows to
                            seamlessly orchestrate resources across high-performance computing, data, and network
                            providers. These interfaces could be REST APIs for programmable workflows, expansive UIs
                            like JupyterLab, or deep integration with external workflow orchestrators.

                            This BoF will summarize the current efforts of the IRI interfaces working group and
                            individual ASCR user facilities to develop new interfaces. We invite the community to
                            provide feedback to help guide these IRI efforts. </li>

                            SciStream is a middlebox-based architecture with control protocols that focuses on security

                            consumers) is secure and efficient. <br /> The team will demonstrate on-demand

            ecosystem, including workflows, design patterns, and specific technologies. While these are not explicitly
            part of the IRI program, conference attendees who are interested in IRI might find these activities to be of

                            workflows that exhibit the Time Sensitive IRI pattern. In addition, because XLOOP focuses on
                            computing and experiments in a synergistic and collaborative relationship, the ideas
                            presented at XLOOP may be of particular interest to attendees interested in IRI.</td>

                            case that exemplifies this new class of emerging workflows. Through a set of lightning talks
                            from user facilities, the BoF will survey how HPC centers address this need today and what
                            they have planned for the near future. These presentations aim to seed the ensuing
                            discussion where the audience can ask questions to key staff of HPC facilities or can bring
                            their specific streaming workflow to the attention of the workflow community.</td>

                            workflow systems within their specific domains. By examining the challenges and
                            opportunities within multi-facility workflows, the session will explore themes such as near
