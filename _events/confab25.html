        <p>There will be multiple IRI presentations at ESnet's upcoming <a
                href="https://www.es.net/news-and-publications/events/confab25/" target="_blank">Confab25</a> conference
            running April 7-9, 2025. Confab is ESnet's largest user meeting, bringing together domain scientists,
            network engineers, DOE program managers, user facility staff, and ESnet staff to co-design the future of
            integrated science. Confab25 will include updates from ESnet, our scientific research collaborators, IRI,
            and more. This is a great opportunity to connect with IRI stakeholders from across the DOE Office of Science
            ecosystem.</p>
