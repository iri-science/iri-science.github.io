                <p>The Department of Energy's vision for Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) is to empower
                    researchers to meld DOE's world-class research tools, infrastructure and user facilities seamlessly
                    and securely in novel ways to radically accelerate discovery and innovation. This will be achieved
                    through the seamless interoperability of research workflows, enabling researchers to gain insight
                    from observational, experimental and simulated data. Decades of research, pilot projects, and
                    demonstrations point to the extraordinary promise of IRI but also the intertwined technological,
                    policy, and sociological challenges of IRI. </p>
                <p>Initial IRI work is currently focusing on defining the structure of the IRI program, setting up the
                    appropriate sub-committees, and partnerships with pathfinder projects. As this work evolves and
                    funding emerges, we expect there to be opportunities for the broader community to engage. For
                    example, the IRI Management Council expects to convene an annual meeting to bring the community
                    together to discuss IRI goals and plans. This website describes places where we initially see
                    opportunities to engage; this will evolve rapidly as we learn from our initial experiences.</p>

                <h3>The Path to IRI</h3>
                <p>The journey to IRI started in 2020 when ASCR convened the IRI Task Force which explored the framework
                    required to better integrate DOE resources. It was followed by a series of activities designed to
                    identify pain points, gather requirements, and build community engagement around the concept of IRI.
                    The results were published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2172/1984466" target="_blank">IRI
                        Architectural Blueprint Activity Report</a> in 2022.</p>

                <h3>Pathfinder Projects</h3>
                <p>A series of discussions with ASCR facilities and leadership put forward a set of science-focused
                    Pathfinder Projects, which will help drive the near-term scope of IRI work by the ASCR facilities.
                    These represent currently active projects that operate at one HPC facility, and are actively working
                    to extend to others. Because IRI is currently unfunded and work on Pathfinder Projects is being done
                    within the current operational scope of the collaborating facilities, the list of Pathfinder
                    Projects is limited. As the IRI program becomes more fully staffed in the coming months, the list of
                    active projects will expand, especially as funding becomes available.</p>
