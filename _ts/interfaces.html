      This working group is established to gather requirements, define use
      cases, and specify unified interfaces for the DOE ASCR Facilities. Beyond defining Application Programmable
      Interfaces (API), this may include the integration of front end applications (e.g., jupyter notebooks) and
      orchestration systems (including hosted orchestration tools). This group is tasked with enhancing the "user
      experience" for interaction and management of complex workflows across High-Performance Computing Facilities,
      High-Performance Data Facilities, and High-Performance Scientific Network Facilities, thereby facilitating a more
      cohesive and efficient research infrastructure. The group will consider applicable standards and build upon the
      work of other organizations where available to deliver a reference IRI interface implementation.
